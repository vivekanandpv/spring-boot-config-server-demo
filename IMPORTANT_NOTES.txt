By default, the configuration values are read on the clientâ€™s startup and not again.
You can force a bean to refresh its configuration (that is, to pull updated values from the
Config Server) by annotating the MessageRestController with the Spring Cloud Config @RefreshScope
and then triggering a refresh event.

You need to invoke the refresh Spring Boot Actuator endpoint in order to force the client to
refresh itself and draw in the new value.
